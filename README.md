This repository now includes a React frontend located in the `client` folder.

## Running the React App

1. Install Node dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The application will be available at the URL printed by the Vite server (usually `http://localhost:5173`).
